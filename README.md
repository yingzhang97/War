# War
 "War" Card Game
War is a card game played often by children that has many variations. I implemented the simple version based on the following rules:

1.Initially shuffle a 52-card standard deck of cards

2.Deal the cards out completely to two players, alternating cards to each player

3.Do the following until one player is out of cards or until a set number of rounds have completed

4.Each player plays the top card in his / her hand

5.If one player's card beats the other that player puts both cards into his discard pile

6.If the players tie, it is a WAR, so do the following until the WAR is resolved:

1）Each player plays a card without comparing

2）Each player plays one more card and compares in the same way as above

3）The winner of the WAR takes all played cards (initially compared cards, uncompared cards, second compared cards).  For a single WAR this will be 6 total cards.

4）If the WAR cards also yield a tie, repeat the process (one uncompared card, one compared card) until there is a winner. Thus a single round of the game could in fact have an arbitrary number of card comparisons and put an arbitrary number of cards at risk.

7.If at any point in the game a player's hand is empty, the player should move the cards in his discard pile into his hand and shuffle them

8.If at any point in the game (even in the middle of a round) a player has no cards remaining in both his / her hand and his / her discard pile, he / she has lost the game.

9.If both players have cards remaining after a set number of rounds (can vary), the player with the most cards (hand + discard pile) is the winner.  In this case, it is possible for a tie to occur, with each player having 26 cards.
